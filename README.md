# Pig Rent
Pig rent is a small 'AirBnB' like app, developed as a [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/) exercise in teams of 4.

As a limited time exercise it's not meant to be a perfect production app.  
However, it's been deployed on Heroku for learning purposes. You can see the 'production site' here: https://pig-rent-redcic75.herokuapp.com/

It's been made with Ruby on Rails framework.
